# Project1_Restaurant
This Restaurant REST API handles reservations, orders and dishes for customers.
  A custom makes a reservation for a certain time with an amount of guests.
  Then a reservation can have multiple orders, which is like a split bills.
  These orders can have orderedDish, which can be something like 3 slices of pizza.
  Then these dishes reference a dish table to know its name and price.
  The price for each order and reservation is automatically calculated using triggers in the backend.
